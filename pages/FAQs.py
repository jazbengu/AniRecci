        AniRecci uses machine learning techniques, such as **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**,

        these based on their relevance and presents you with the top recommendations.

    st.markdown("### What dataset does AniRecci use?")
    st.write("""
        AniRecci uses a custom dataset of anime titles, including metadata such as descriptions, genres, ratings, 
        and popularity scores. This dataset is sourced from **MyAnimeList** via the Jikan API.

    st.markdown("### Why are some anime missing or unavailable?")
    st.write("""
        AniRecci relies on the MyAnimeList API to fetch details about anime titles. If certain anime are missing, 
        it could be due to limitations in the API or the dataset being used. We're continuously updating the system 
        to include more titles.

    st.markdown("### How do you handle missing or incomplete data?")
    st.write("""
        If any data is missing (e.g., descriptions or genres), AniRecci fills those fields with default placeholders. 
        For example, missing descriptions are replaced with "No description available."
